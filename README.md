# German-Translator
This code is a Python program that uses the "translate" library to translate words into German.

The line from translate import Translator imports the Translator class from the translate library.
The translate_to_german function asks the user to input a word, creates a Translator object to translate the word to German, prints the translated word, and then returns the translated word.
Finally, translate_to_german() calls the function to execute the translation process.
